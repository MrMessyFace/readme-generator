# README Generator

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Node.js app that generates a README.md file using inquiries that collects data from the user.

## Installation

I used Node.js and inquirer.

## Usage

When a user opens the Main directory in their command line, they would install Inquirer and then use Node.js on the index.js file. This would ask a series of questions that will fill in the sections of the README.md file that will be generated.

## Credits

Starter code was provided to me in the bootcamp but was updated based on activities that were worked on in class.
